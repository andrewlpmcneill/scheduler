# Scheduler Project

Scheduler is a single-page interview appointment application.

This repository is the result of my practice and first experience with React. Naturally, HTML, CSS3, JS, and AJAX front-end skills were required, as well as Node skills and Jest and Cypress testing skills.

Scheduler was tested using Jest for unit-testing, and Cypress for end-to-end testing. It served as an introduction for me to both.

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the npm install command).
- This project requires scheduler-api and a PostgreSQL database. Run the API server using npm start in that project's root directory.
- Run the webpack development web server (using the npm start command).
- Point your browser to localhost:8000 and start booking some interviews!

## Dependencies

- React v16.9.0 or above
- Axios
